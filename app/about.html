		<h2>A LITTLE <span>ABOUT</span> ME</h2>
	</div>
    <p>Hi, my name is Corey Dunkin, I am a Designer/Developer based in Sydney and this is my website. I enjoy building websites/webapps, illustration, photography, typhography and being creative in general. I've worked for clients such as <span class="maccasyellow">McDonald's</span>, <span class="vwblue">Volkswagen</span>, <span class="telstrapink">Telstra</span> and <span class="arnottsred">Arnotts</span>. In my spare time, when iâ€™m not coding or designing, I like playing my bass guitar, playing video games or messing about in various designer/developer apps.</p>
